Figuring Out Mission Success Criterea
---------------------------------------------------
-Not too difficult to remove orbital analysis figure.
	-Making results into list form is also fairly trivial

-Do we care how we go about acheiving orbital maneuvers?
	-Thus, is a key goal of the mission to prove the useability of a propulsion system?
	-Or do we want to focus on undergoing orbital maneuvers?
	-What are we trying to prove?
		-Perform Proximity Operations and Rendezvous through the use of a 6U spacecraft architecture (mission objective)

-Make sure to define each term used in proximity operations

-Mission Success Criterea
	-Stationkeeping within a 10-75 m sphere of a resident space object (or keep old one)
	-Rendezvous within a distance of 1-10 m from a distance of at least 100 m (or keep old one)
	-Do we want to demonstrate collision avoidance? (Escape, etc.)
