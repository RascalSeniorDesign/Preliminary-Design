Weekly Design Meeting Minutes-10-15-2013
==================

Updated RFP Comments
-What are the limits of operation for the orbital maneuvers?
	-This would depend on the componenets that are selected.

-Should take out orbital analysis figure, too much information for RFP.
-Results should be in list form, as to ease reading of the RFP to a reviewer. 
	-Should be able to see if we can meet the parameters with the design we have.

-Take and out of mission statement.
-Need more specificity in mission objective with regards to sizing contraints.
	-Don't need to make it seem like the propulsion system is being developed as a mission success criterea.
	-Should say that a propuslion system fits within a 3U and is capable of acheiving a delta V of X m/s.
		-Easy way to do this is so say that it meets CubeSat design spec Rev 3
	-Should say that it has a delta v reqirement and a pointing requriement

-The configuration of the satellite could change depending on what seems reasonable, 6U is total size.

-For CONOPS, should say that inital contact has to be met within X number of weeks
-Need to include critical requirements associated with launch, not a specific CONOPS, in the RFP.
-One requirement should be related to range of orbital ranges in which the mission can be acheived.

-Need to specify paylaod capabilities (weight, volume, etc.)

-Components trades studies usually are not until after PDR.
	-PDR is about architecture, size of solar panels, etc.
	-VHF/UHF/Laser COM, etc.
	-CDR is about finiding specific companies to provide parts

-Configruation design can be pushed as well.
	-Can do rough outlook of what goes into each satelltie.
	-But, can we do this with two 3U's? Do we want a bigger and smaller one? Etc.
	-Mission design will take all semseter, component trade-offs are later.

-Also want to add Data budget before the end of the semester.

-Should look into number of image sensors, type of sensors, power trade offs, etc.
