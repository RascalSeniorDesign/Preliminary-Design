Attendees: Dr. Lebeau, Bryant Gaume, Tom Moline, Tyler Olson, Nate Richard

RFP Discussion
======
-Length is a lot better
-Allows for greater flexiblity in design choices
-Good to have concept down-select, as to bring it up later in reviews
-Is there a resonable maximum mission lifetime?
	-Don't want to have ground crew active for 25 years.
	-Need to offer an end point.
	-Don't say it is reasonable to set, say that it must be accomplished between certain dates

-What is the orbit range?
	-Does it matter?
	-Specifiy Low Earth Orbit at least.
	-This could be a small paragraph in the introduction.
	-Might not be necessary.

-Perhaps change Appendix to an actual name.
-Check and see if font changed for mission requirements.

GANNT Chart
=====
-Had to move SRR to November 11.
	-This is where the mission is fully defined.
	-Should figure out what counts as a constraint analysis.

-At report stage, should be confident that mission is feaseable.
-Can also figure out cost stuff, that that isn't necessary.

-Should look and see if we are going down critical paths (what determines the final design?)
	-Can make a plan going forward into next semester.
