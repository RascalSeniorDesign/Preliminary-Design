===
-Constraint analysis dertermines what is necessary before actually constructing spacecraft
-What do we have to meet right now?
	-Know what to do going forward
-This should be a top-level analysis for constraint
	-Do all my components have mass less tahn 8 kg
	-Do I fit volume?
	-Etc.
-Should also look into battery sizing and power life
	-This is a key driver of constraints
-One example of a good constraint is the release relative velocity
	-Could perform a trade study on this
	-Could look into propellent design, thrusters, etc.
